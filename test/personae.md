# People who use minicomp

* **Trace**: A harried RA graduate student in English who simply wants things
  done. Trace is mostly following orders from the PI, Filomena, and has nearly
no experience with the command line.

* **Filomena**: The PI on a project that for some reason is tied to minicomp.
  Only interested in the god view.

* **Mabel**: A graduate student in History looking to build a project sticking
  to the tenets of Minimal Computing. Mabel wants to not only do, but learn.
She is our favorite user real talk.

* **London**: A developer in a university library with minicomp foisted upon
  him in resentment. Distrusts the results and wants to be able to check
whatâ€™s going on in some easy way and extend at will. Maybe also patch into
other frameworks.

* **Amari**: A digital cultures professor who is planning a paper about the phenomenon of minimal computing and wants to try out some tools so they get the technical details right when they write about it.

* **Kurtis**: An academic teaching an graduate course on data management who wants to expose students to a variety of different approaches and tools. 

* **Raven**: A researcher working with sensitive data who is hardcore concerned about security and will only use software that is simple to audit and less popular so people are less likely to attack it.

* **Leone** is an independent scholar who is running everything on cloud-based infrastructure and is charged by the CPU cycle, so is looking for minimal software for all aspects of their research.

* **Blake** is a grad student who has a basement full of old computer hardware. Blake is trying to prove to a circle of nerdy friends that you can do a DH project from start to finish on an aging machine that won't install any fully-featured modern software.

* **Amy**: A researcher submitting a grant proposal who was told to come up with a research data management plan and wanted to say what tools she would be using. She picked the first piece of software she saw mentioned on Twitter where she only follows @elotroalex and @muziejus
